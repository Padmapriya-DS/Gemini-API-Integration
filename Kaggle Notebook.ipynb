      "    2. **Image 1 (0-3 seconds):** Show the weirdly distorted AI result (the dragon has 8 legs, the bicycle is melted).\n",
      "    3. **Rapid Transition (0.5 seconds):** Switch to the next fail immediately.\n",
      "    4. **Text Overlay (Top):** \"Prompt: 'A friendly dog holding a cup of coffee.'\"\n",

      "    3. **Segment 2 (21-35 seconds):** Switch to an AI video/image generator (like Pika, Runway, or Midjourney) and rapidly create 4-5 clips or images to match the song's theme.\n",
      "    4. **Final Reveal (36-55 seconds):** Play the final 15-20 second snippet of the complete, AI-generated song and video.\n",

      "This is a great topic! Python decorators are powerful, but they often sound more complicated than they actually are.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is an explanation of Python decorators broken down into simple words, an analogy, and the essential technical details.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## 🐍 Python Decorators: The Simple Explanation\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine you have a function that already does a job (like baking a cake). A **decorator** is just a simple way to **wrap** or **modify** that existing function to add new features or change its behavior, **without actually changing the function's original code.**\n",
      "\n",
      "### 🍰 The Analogy (Adding Icing to a Cake)\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **The Original Function (The Cake):** You have a function called `bake_cake()`. It works perfectly fine and produces a plain vanilla cake.\n",
      "2.  **The Decorator (The Icing/Sprinkles):** You want the cake to be special. You create a decorator called `@add_icing`.\n",
      "3.  **The Application:** Instead of opening up the `bake_cake()` recipe and adding \"Step 10: Put on Icing,\" you simply put the decorator right before your function definition:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "@add_icing # <--- This is the decorator\n",
      "def bake_cake():\n",
      "    print(\"Cake is baked.\")\n",
      "    # (The original code remains untouched)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Result:** Now, whenever you call `bake_cake()`, it automatically executes the icing logic *around* the cake baking, making it tastier, but the core `bake_cake` process is exactly the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## 🛠️ The Essential Technical Details\n",
      "\n",
      "Technically speaking, a decorator is just a function that **takes another function as an input and returns a modified version of that function.**\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Functions are First-Class Objects\n",
      "\n",
      "The foundation of decorators is the idea that in Python, **functions can be treated like variables** (or \"first-class objects\"). This means you can:\n",
      "*   Pass a function to another function as an argument.\n",
      "*   Return a function from another function.\n",
      "*   Store a function in a variable.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. The `@` Syntax (Syntactic Sugar)\n",
      "\n",
      "The `@decorator_name` syntax is just Python's shortcut (or \"syntactic sugar\") for doing this manually:\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Shortcut (Using `@`):**\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "@my_decorator\n",
      "def say_hello():\n",
      "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**What Python is actually doing (Manual Wrapping):**\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def say_hello():\n",
      "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
      "\n",
      "# The function is passed to the decorator,\n",
      "# and the result (the wrapped function) replaces the original\n",
      "say_hello = my_decorator(say_hello)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Common Uses\n",
      "\n",
      "Decorators are everywhere in Python because they promote clean, reusable code.\n",
      "\n",
      "| Use Case | Description | Example |\n",
      "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
      "| **Logging** | Automatically log when a function starts and finishes. | `@log_execution` |\n",
      "| **Timing** | Measure how long a function takes to run. | `@time_it` |\n",
      "| **Permission** | Check if a user is logged in or has the right permissions before running a sensitive function (common in web frameworks like Django/Flask). | `@login_required` |\n",
      "| **Caching** | Store the results of an expensive function call so it doesn't have to run again. | `@functools.cache` |\n",

      "## The Core Concept: `yield` Makes a Function a Generator\n",
      "\n",
      "When a Python function contains the `yield` keyword, it automatically stops being a regular function and becomes a **generator function**.\n",
      "\n",
      "A generator function doesn't return a single value and exit; instead, it returns an **iterator** (the generator object) that can be paused and resumed on demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. The Standard `return`\n",
      "\n",
      "The `return` statement gives a value back to the caller, and the function's state is **destroyed** (it starts from the beginning next time).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. The `yield` Statement\n",
      "\n",
      "The `yield` statement gives a value back to the caller, but the function's state is **frozen** (paused). When the caller asks for the next value, the function resumes *exactly* where it left off, including all local variables and execution points.\n",

      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## Simple Example: Counting with `yield`\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's compare a standard list-generating function with a generator function. We want a function that generates the numbers 1, 2, and 3.\n",

      "    in memory (a list) before returning.\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",
      "    results = []\n",

      "**Output Analysis (Scenario A):**\n",
      "1. `regular_counter()` runs entirely, printing \"Starting\" and \"Finished.\"\n",
      "2. The entire list `[1, 2, 3]` is built in memory.\n",
      "3. We then iterate over the *already existing* list.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Scenario B: Using `yield` (Generator Creation)\n",
      "\n",

      "1. When `generator_counter()` is called, we only see \"Generator object created.\" The code inside the generator is dormant.\n",
      "2. The `for` loop starts, acting as the consumer.\n",
      "3. The generator runs up to `yield 1`, prints \"Starting generator,\" returns 1, and **PAUSES**.\n",
      "4. The consumer prints \"Received: 1.\"\n",

      "6. The generator **RESUMES** (printing \"Resumed after 1\"), runs up to `yield 2`, returns 2, and **PAUSES** again.\n",
      "7. The consumer prints \"Received: 2.\"\n",

      "## Why Use `yield`? The Benefits of Generators\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary reasons generators are preferred in professional Python code are related to **efficiency** and **memory management**:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Lazy Evaluation (On-Demand)\n",
      "\n",
      "Generators only compute the next item when requested. This is known as **lazy evaluation**. If you only need the first 10 items of a sequence of a million, a generator only computes those 10. A standard function computes all million items upfront.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Memory Efficiency (Scalability)\n",
      "\n",
      "The generator never holds the entire sequence in memory. It holds only the state needed to calculate the *next* item. This is critical when dealing with very large datasets (like reading a huge log file line by line) where loading everything into memory simultaneously would crash your system.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Infinite Sequences\n",
      "\n",
      "You can create a generator for an infinite sequence (like all prime numbers) because you never have to worry about running out of memory. The consumer just keeps asking for the next item as long as they need it.\n"
